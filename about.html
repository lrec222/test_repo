<h2> <p> Central Perk opened in May 1993 and is located in the center of Manhattan for your easiest coffee access.
Since then, our baristas and chefs have been serving delicious drinks and meals for all New York natives,
visitors and regulars, making our shop to be known as the "Friendly Coffee Cafe" </p> </h2>

<h2> <p> You might also recognize the name "Central Perk" from the popular sitcom Friends,
  airing from 1993-2003 with actors Jennifer Aniston, Courtney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matthew Perry,
  Matthew LeBlanc and David Schwimmer. This show inspried us to open an actual Central Perk,
  and not just fantasize about it while watching the show. </p> </h2>
